# Experimenting with Racketscript

The goal of this repo is to do the following:

1. Implement some applications _outside_ of standard Racket/HtDP use cases, e.g. web app frontends
2. Create potentially useful reference material for future users and for comparison with other frameworks (e.g. 7GUI)
3. Investigate the developer experience of the language and motivate future language, tooling, or related work
4. Experiment with frontend-oriented DSLs for writing declarative UIs using idiomatic Racket
